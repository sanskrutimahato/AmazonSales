# Amazon Sales Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end **Power BI dashboard** built to explore Amazon sales data across multiple product categories and countries.

The analysis is based on a **consolidated fact table** created by merging product-level sales data with country-level performance metrics inside Power BI.  
The primary goal of this project is to practice **data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design**, while gradually improving business insight generation.

This repository is maintained as a **living project** and will be updated as my data analytics skills continue to grow.
